# Bluetooth-Toolkit by PrograMonks

A sample app that has some basic functionalities for BT Classic and BLE. Peripheral functionalities are in progress.

The location permissions are needed for the BLE scanning operations. Not sure if this is a bug or if Google actually wanted to force having this permission enabled to do a BLE scan.
